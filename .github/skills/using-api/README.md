# Using API Skill

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for using the VDE Game API to create games, demos, applications, and examples.

## Quick Reference

- **Skill File:** [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) - Complete guide for using the VDE API
- **Template:** [API_SUGGESTION_TEMPLATE.md](API_SUGGESTION_TEMPLATE.md) - Template for documenting API improvement suggestions

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Creating a new game or application with the VDE Game API
- Building interactive demos using Scene/Entity/Resource system
- Implementing gameplay features
- Working with cameras, lighting, input, or entities
- Need practical examples of common API patterns

## What This Skill Covers

1. **API Structure** - Understanding Game → Scene → Entity hierarchy
2. **Standard Patterns** - How to structure applications and scenes
3. **Common Tasks** - Creating entities, cameras, handling input, managing resources
4. **Best Practices** - Ownership rules, lifecycle management, performance tips
5. **Workarounds** - How to handle current API limitations
6. **Improvement Suggestions** - How to document API enhancement ideas

## Key Documents

Always refer to these documents when using the API:
- `API-DOC.md` - Complete Game API reference
- `docs/API.md` - Core engine API
- `examples/` - Working example applications

## Suggesting API Improvements

If you discover an API limitation while working:

1. **Document it** using the [API_SUGGESTION_TEMPLATE.md](API_SUGGESTION_TEMPLATE.md)
2. **Complete your task** using the current API (implement a workaround)
3. **Save suggestion** as `API_SUGGESTION_[NAME].md` in project root

The goal is to deliver working solutions while providing feedback for future improvements.
