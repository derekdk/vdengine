description: Work on the next phase of work planned.

Look at the referenced plan and determine the next phase of work to be done.
Identify the tasks involved in this phase and outline a clear approach to accomplish them. Consider dependencies, required resources, and potential challenges. 
Start work immediately on the tasks identified for this phase.
If new functionality is added create an example/demo to showcase it.
Always run the tests after making changes to ensure nothing is broken. If any tests fail, investigate and fix the issues before proceeding.
Run the example/demo to verify that the new functionality works as expected and meets the requirements outlined in the plan. Each demo should be able to self-terminate after a short period of time.
Confirm with the user that the demo meets their expectations and make any necessary adjustments based on their feedback.
