Look at the referenced plan and determine the next phase of work to be done.
Identify the tasks involved in this phase and outline a clear approach to accomplish them. Consider dependencies, required resources, and potential challenges. 
Start work immediately on the tasks identified for this phase.
If new functionality is added create an example/demo to showcase it.
Confirm with the user that the demo meets their expectations and make any necessary adjustments based on their feedback.
